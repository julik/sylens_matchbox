## Basics
 
This shader will undistort and redistort footage according to the Syntheyes model. It's called SyLens after it's more
powerful cousin, [SyLens for Nuke.](http://github.com/julik/sylens)

## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/julik/sylens_matchbox/archive/master.zip) and unpack the repository, then open a Terminal and cd into the directory where you have unpacked it.
From there, run the installer shell script:

	$ ./installer.sh

Since the matchbox directories are protected from non-admin users by default, copying will be done as sudo - so either run the installer
as root or be ready to enter your password. On the Mac, your main user will be a sudoer by default. On Linux, your Flame/Smoke user will likely NOT
be a sudoer so you will have to run the installer as root.

The installer script will copy the shader into all of the versions of the software that support Matchbox shaders. Once you grab a fresh Matchbox node the SyLens
shader icon will show up in your Matchbox shaders list.

You will need to rerun the installer everytime you install an update for your IFFS applications (since every new install
creates a new `matchbox` directory) 

## Dealing with non-square pixels (anamorphic footage)

SyLens deals with anamorphic plates correctly if you correctly configure the pixel aspect ratio in your node output / clip metadata.

## Dealing with overscan when removing distortion

When you are undistorting images it sometimes produces oversize images. By default the overflow pixels will be
simply cropped away, however if you expand the **Canvas Resolution** of your shader, you will see that the output
will still be centered in your canvas. So, to recover the overflow pixels, expand your output until all the pixels are
covered.

Remember that the undistorted plate will always have the same aspect ratio as the original.

## Dealing with overscan when applying distortion

Same procedure as when removing distortion. Adjust your output size until you are happy with the result, or set the output to your original plate pixel dimensions.

## Use in setups

Do not worry about always using the latest version of the shader - the shader you use will actually be **copied** to your setup
so there is no problem versioning it.
